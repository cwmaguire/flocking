flocking
========

Trying out ideas from "Artificial Intelligence for Games"

Currently focussing on "boids" and "flocking"; I've got some rudimentary
flocking happening with boids the fly in circles (actually rectangles,
but whatever). This is now at a stage where I have the movement and
animations working and I can beging to experiment rather. Up to know
I've been hammering in a lot of plumbing to get things up and running.

I enjoy inventing wheels, which is while you'll see a lot of hokey,
home-grown code to do with logging, testing and functional staples like
map, reduce, foldl. If I was doing this "seriously" I'd be using
ClojureScript with the full power of a Lisp. Actually I probably should
have but I didn't think I'd stick with it this long. Isn't that always
the way? :)
